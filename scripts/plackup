=head1 NAME

plackup - Run PSGI application with Plack servers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # read your app from app.psgi file
  plackup

  # can be passed as an ARGV[0] (or with -a option)
  plackup hello.psgi

  # Switch server implementation with --server (or -s)
  plackup --server HTTP::Server::Simple --port 9090 --host 127.0.0.1 test.psgi

  # Use UNIX socket to run FCGI daemon
  plackup -s FCGI --listen /tmp/fcgi.sock myapp.psgi

  # FCGI external server on port 9090
  plackup -s FCGI --port 9090

=head1 DESCRIPTION

plackup is a command line utility to run PSGI application from the command line.

plackup automatically figures out the environment it is run in, and
runs your application in that environment. FastCGI, CGI, AnyEvent and
others can all be detected. See L<Plack::Loader> for the authorative
list.

C<plackup> assumes you have an C<app.psgi> script in your current
directory, that would look like:

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  use MyApp;
  my $app = MyApp->new;
  my $handler = sub { $app->run_psgi(@_) };

The last statement of C<app.psgi> should be a code reference that is a
PSGI application.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item .psgi

  plackup --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9090 /path/to/app.psgi

The first non-option argument is used as a C<.psgi> file path. You can
also set this path with C<-a> or C<--app> option. If omitted, the
default file path is C<app.psgi> in the current directory.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -a, --app

C<--app> option allows you to locate a C<.psgi> script with a
different name in a different path. This can also be set as a
non-option argument. (See above)

=item -e

Evaluate the given perl code as a PSGI app, much like perl's C<-e>
option.

=item -o, --host

The interface a TCP based server daemon binds to. Defauts to undef,
which lets most server backends bind the any (*) interface. This
opeion doesn't mean anything if the server does not support TCP
socket.

=item -p, --port

The port number a TCP based server daemon listens on. Defaults to
5000. This option doesn't mean anything if the server does not support
TCP socket.

=item -s, --server

Select a specific implementation to run on using the C<PLACK_SERVER>
environment variable or use the C<-s> or C<--server> flag which will
be prefered over the environment variable if present.

=item -S, --socket

UNIX domain socket path to listen on. Defaults to undef. This option
doesn't mean anything if the server doesn't support UNIX sockets.

=item -l, --listen

Addresses to listen on. It could be "HOST:PORT", ":PORT" or "PATH"
(without colons). It could be multiple but it depends on the server
implementations whether multiple interfaces are supported.

=item -D, --daemonize

Makes the process go background. It's up to the backend server/handler
implementation whether this option is respected or not.

=item -I

Specify perl library include path, like C<perl>'s -I option.

=item -M

Specify modules to load before loading the app code.

=item -E, --env

Specify the environment option (default is C<development>). You can
set this value by setting C<PLACK_ENV> environment variable as well,
and specifying the value with the command line options writes back to
C<PLACK_ENV> as well, so applications or frameworks can tell which
environment setting the application is running on.

  # These two are the same
  plackup -E deployment
  env PLACK_ENV=deployment plackup

The value can be anything but commonly used ones are C<development>,
C<deployment> and C<test>.

If it's set to C<development>, following middleware is enabled by
default: L<AccessLog>, L<StackTrace>.

=item -r, --reload

Make plackup to watch updates from your development directory and
restarts the server whenever a file is updated. This option by default
watches the C<lib> directory and the base directory where I<.psgi>
file is located. Use C<-R> if you want to watch other directories.

=item -R, --Reload

C<-R> option allows you to specify the path to watch file updates
separated by comma (C<,>).

  plackup -R /path/to/project/lib,/path/to/project/templates

=item -L, --loader

Specify the server loading subclass that implements how to run the
server. Available options are I<Plack::Loader> (default), I<Restarter>
(automatically set when C<-r> or C<-R> is used) and I<Shotgun>.

=back

Other options that starts with C<--> are passed through to the backend
server. See each Plack::Server backend documentations to see which
options are available.
