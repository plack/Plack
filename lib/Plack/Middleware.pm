=head1 NAME

Plack::Middleware - Base class for easy-to-use PSGI middleware

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Plack::Middleware::Foo;
  use parent qw( Plack::Middleware );

  sub call {
      my($self, $env) = @_;
      # Do something with $env

      # $self->app is the original app
      my $res = $self->app->($env);

      # Do something with $res
      return $res;
  }

  # then in app.psgi
  use Plack::Builder;

  my $app = sub { ... } # as usual

  builder {
      enable "Plack::Middleware::Foo";
      enable "Plack::Middleware::Bar", %options;
      $app;
  };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plack::Middleware is an utility base class to write PSGI
middleware. All you have to do is to inherit from Plack::Middleware
and then implement the callback C<call> method (or C<to_app> method
that would return the PSGI code reference) to do the actual work. You
can use C<< $self->app >> to call the original (wrapped) application.

See L<Plack::Builder> how to actually enable middlewares in your
I<.psgi> application file using the DSL. If you do not like our
builder DSL, you can also use C<wrap> method to wrap your application
with a middleware:

  use Plack::Middleware::Foo;

  my $app = sub { ... };
  $app = Plack::Middleware::Foo->wrap($app, %options);
  $app = Plack::Middleware::Bar->wrap($app, %options);

=head1 CAVEATS

A new object is B<not> allocated per request.  Don't try to cache the
request or environment in the object.
