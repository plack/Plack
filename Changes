    [NEW FEATURES]
        - Plack::Test now has a simpler object-oriented interface that doesn't
          take multiple callbacks. #420

    [IMPROVEMENTS]
        - bump dependencies for Test::TCP and HTTP::Tiny
        - Set no_proxy for HTTP::Tiny in tests (kazeburo)

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    [IMPROVEMENTS]
        - Skip cgi related tests for Win32 (chorny) #413

        - Skip tests that require HTTP::Cookies, if not available #414

1.0027  2013-06-13 21:30:12 PDT

          (for PSGI handlers) without LWP installed, the tests will automatically be skipped.

        - Plack::Request and Response are now in core, deprecating many methods.
