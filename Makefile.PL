warn <<RECOMMENDS;

  This is Plack, PSGI toolkit containing servers, middleware and utils.

  To run the default backends faster with XS extensions, as well as run some server
  backends like Prefork and FCGI, you need to install additional Perl module dependencies,
  that are included in Task::Plack bundle. You're recommended to run

    cpan> install Task::Plack

  once this distribution is installed. Enjoy!
